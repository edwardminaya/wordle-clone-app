# Wordle Clone

This is a simple program that clones the wordle game. If you have not played it you can check it out here from New York Times.
[Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)

This project is to practice my programming skills and learn how to refactore and improve the code over time.

# Installation

You can clone the app to your machine and run in your terminal.

# Usage

Run the wordle.rb file in your command line.

The current version wil prompt user to enter a guess. Each guess will appear at the top with green, yellow or grey letters indicating which letters are in the correct spot, in the word but not in the correct spot and not in the word. After 5 tries the program will end by displaying the target word.

# Future Developments

- Add feature to track each games number of tries it took to guess the target word.
- Add feature to display definition of target word.
